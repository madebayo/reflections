What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You are basically telling git that you plan to eventually track changes to file in this directory/repo.  You need to do it so git can ready the repo for eventual tracking.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediary between the working directory.  Files you plan to eventually commit are temporarily placed there.  I believe it keeps things cleaner and helps you keep track of what you are planning to eventually commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Perhaps by adding your file to the staging area after the change??

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When you need to make like an experimental change. Branches allow you to do so without changing the main (master) branch!

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Well, trying to keep up with all that information in your head is difficult.  Diagrams make it easier.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Commit histories are combined by timestamp.  The diagram gives a visual representation of what's happening for easier understanding.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
pro - git does pretty well in automatic merging
con - it cannot ascertain what you were trying to do so you may have to do manually merging.

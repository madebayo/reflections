What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You are basically telling git that you plan to eventually track changes to file in this directory/repo.  You need to do it so git can ready the repo for eventual tracking.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediary between the working directory.  Files you plan to eventually commit are temporarily placed there.  I believe it keeps things cleaner and helps you keep track of what you are planning to eventually commit.

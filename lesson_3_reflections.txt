When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you're working on a project that other team members will need access to, you'd want to use a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may not be ready to pull particular changes down.
